# truss-optimization-with-sga

SGA (Search Group Algorithm) is an optimization metaheuristic algorithm developed by [Matheus Silva Gon√ßalves (2015)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274253521_Search_group_algorithm_A_new_metaheuristic_method_for_the_optimization_of_truss_structures) for the optimization of truss structures.

This repository contains the code used for my undergraduate thesis ["Using Search Group Algorithm for size, shape and topology optimization of planar trusses with Python"](https://repositorio.ufsc.br/handle/123456789/232531). In this paper, i've applied SGA to solve 5 planar trusses problems, trying to minimize the total structure mass. The results were compared with other authors that have used diferent methods such as **Firefly Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization.**
